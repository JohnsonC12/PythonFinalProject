# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Horserace(Derby)------ Derby = title

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Im trying to make a multiplayer virtual game where the main objective is to just get to the finishing line. I got this idea from a card game that my friends play where each player bet on a card, and if that card reach the end then the person who bet that card is the winner.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

my software will ask the players which card they would like to bet on. and the game will start with stack of deck where it chooses hearts or spades, etc.. then they will keep drawing until the card reaches to the end. the features I want it to have is a finishing line where the cards that chosen be represented by horses.

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I do not have any other classes that are doing final projects.

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
None.


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what? A good outcome is atleast finishing the base of the game where it ask the players which card would like and it would assign them the cards. then they will draw a random card. and instead of horses, a good outcome is atleast an arrow going across to the finishing line.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can atleast get the players the assigned cards that they desire. also create a randomization where it will draw our cards.

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
the best outcome is everything getting finished. like having a finishing line and the software asking the player what card they want and it actually working where we see a card game verison of horse racing.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Next step for me to do is research more about the code "random" or dictionary. So i will be successful with remaking the game exactly how I am thinking about it right now. Also I will also do research on the card game that my friends show me so I don't miss any minor detail while I try to create this game. I do not have other classmate so I will be doing the research and brainstorming by myself
